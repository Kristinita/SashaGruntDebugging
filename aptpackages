#
# [NOTE] In Ubuntu, the user must select an installation package that matches the processor architecture.
# AMD64 is default Travis CI architecture:

# For another architectures AMD64 packages may not work.
# On the Ubuntu packages site selection a version for specific processor architecture may be required.

# fd #
######
# [OVERVIEW] "fd" — user-friendly alternative to Linux command "find":
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
#
# [INFO] I use "fd" for command-line apps that doesn’t support
# glob and ignoring files.
#
# [INFO] I selected "fd" instead of "find", because fd supports by default
# files from ".gitignore":
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#features
#
# [INFO] "fd" by default search files recursively in current working directory:
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#list-all-files-recursively
#
# [NOTE][REQUIRED] Symlink for Ubuntu installation:
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#on-ubuntu
#
#
# [LEARN][UNIX] "xargs" — utility for running the second command for each element
# of the first command:
# https://losst.pro/komanda-xargs-linux
#
# [INFO] I use "xargs" in cases where first command is a list of required files,
# second command — command-line utility without glob and ignoring support.
#
# [NOTE] Native command execution syntax doesn’t work on Windows:
# "fd --extension coffee --exec coffeelint"
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#command-execution
# https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Kristinita/sashatravis/builds/48897625#L57
#
# [INFO] Use xargs syntax. It works for both: Linux and Windows:
# "fd -0 --extension coffee | xargs -0 coffeelint"
# https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#using-fd-with-xargs-or-parallel
# https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Kristinita/sashatravis/builds/48897625#L51
# https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Kristinita/SashaTravis/builds/268175013#L244
#
# [REQUIRED] "-0" in "fd" and "xargs" commands
#
#
# [NOTE] No easy way to install the latest version of fd-find on Ubuntu:

#
# [NOTE] 8.3.1-1 is the latest apt fd-find version for Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish:
